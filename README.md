# Anime Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of an anime dataset containing information about **1,992 anime titles**. The analysis explores various aspects of the anime industry, including ratings, genres, popularity trends, and production characteristics.

## üìä Project Purpose

This script was developed as an **educational example** for data analysis techniques using Python. The extensive comments throughout the code serve as learning aids to help other students understand:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques
- Statistical analysis approaches
- pandas and matplotlib operations

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

The original dataset (no longer available online) contained the following key features:

- **Title** - Anime title (example: Shingeki no Kyojin)
- **Production** - Production studios (example: Wit Studio)
- **Episodes** - Episode count (example: 25)
- **Source** - Indicates the original material from which the anime was adapted (example: Manga)
- **Genre** - Genre classifications (example: "Action,Drama,Fantasy,Mystery")
- **Airdate** - Represents the broadcast period of the anime (example: "Apr 7, 2013, 01:58 (JST)")
- **Rating** - Ratings and score distributions (example: 8.52)
- **Voters** - Indicates the number of users who rated the anime on the source platform (example: "3,142,121")
- **Theme** - Describes the central themes, motifs, and narrative elements of the anime (example: "Military,Super Power")

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **numpy** - Numerical computations

## üìà Analysis Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Data type conversions
- Data normalization

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- Outputting the first lines
- Displaying information about columns in a dataset
- Bringing column headings to a uniform format
- For each column containing categorical features, output all possible values
- Distribution of anime ratings
- Genre popularity analysis
- Studio performance comparisons

### 3. Statistical Insights
- Correlation analysis between features
- For each column containing numeric values, output statistics

### 4. Visualization
- Building a column chart of company ratings
- A bar chart visualization of the number of anime that fall into certain rating ranges
- Plotting a linear graph of anime ratings versus the number of viewers
- Visualization of other simple dependencies
